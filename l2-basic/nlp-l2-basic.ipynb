To give you some guidance: The total number of positive examples is approximately 58M, and the batch size is chosen so that each batch contains roughly 10% of these examples. To speed things up, you can train using a GPU; our reference implementation runs in less than 2 minutes per epoch on [Colab](http://colab.research.google.com)."
